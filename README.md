## About the dataset
The AG's news topic classification dataset is constructed by choosing 4 largest classes from the original corpus. Each class contains 30,000 training samples and '1,900' testing samples. The total number of training samples is 120,000 and testing 7,600.
## task1
we do preprocessing at data and Calculate the probabilities of N_Grams
## task2
finally, we end the project by doing :
* Feature extraction ( apply all 3 algorithms with the classifier and choose the best according to the model's accuracy)
* ML classifier ( apply any ML classifier SVM, NB, DT, RF, etc.) and evaluation metrics ( including model's accuracy, confusion matrix )
